# There were many challenges while building this final website. Firstly trying to make the 
# the appearance as closely as possible to the original without sacrificing the overall look and feel of the website. My original font that I used for the main title was an adobe font and therefore not compatible with vscode. Finding a suitable replacement that would work for the website was difficult but I was ultimately able to overcome this. Getting more comfortable with using animations and bootstrap variables posed more challenged than anticipated. Finding animations that not only worked, but fit with the concept of the website as well was a hard task to make work. I went back to look at the pseudo judo assignment to refamiliarize myself witht he work we had previously done. I have learned to be patient and look to the necessary framework that has been laid out as a way to achieve the things I am looking for in my code. Refering back to previous work or to other exercises has been  huge aid in the process of learning how to code properly.
# Here is a list of the frameworks, images, resources,fonts and links I used on this assignment.
# 1. font: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif...
